3.00-release

Fixes, mostly to fix the display of Arabic translations.

 o Put the title and description into separate widgets in the Translator
   screen, as joining them with "\n\n" and putting the result into one
   widget caused very odd display issues in Arabic.

 o Removed halign setting from Translator screen text widgets - so that
   it can handle rtol languages

 o Remove Python2 code handling.

 o Sort language names in the user's locale.

 o Change sepline to "**********".  "==========" did not work for
   Persian translations, and "&&&&&&&&&&" failed for some other
   languages.

 o Add a second (alternate) translation language.  You toggle between
   the two translations with the Back button.

 o The Help/Info screen is now translated to the defautl Enigma2
   language rather then the translation language.

 o Changed the Skin definition to be a single one with a defined
   resolution, and use standard "key_*" style entries.

 o Add red/green/OK/Back/Menu button action descriptions to the
   Translator screen

 o Replaced the flag display with a simple language name field.

 o Added a keymap for EventViewActions

3.01-release

 o Cater for Google translate returning fewer *s than sent (sepline).

 o Add KEY_PREVIOUS as equivalent of KEY_BACK in keymapping.
